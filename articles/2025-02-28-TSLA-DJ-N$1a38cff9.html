<p>&#10;  Al Root </p>&#10;<p>&#10;  Tesla stock just had its second-worst month ever. At least it snapped a losing streak on Friday. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Investors are looking for things that can turn the tide and looking for leadership from CEO Elon Musk. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Shares of the electric vehicle maker rose 3.9% on Friday, closing at $293.04, snapping a six-day losing streak. The S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.6% and 1.4%, respectively. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     February was the second-worth month on record for the stock. Tesla shares fell almost 28% in February. Of the 20 trading days in the month, shares dropped on 14 of them. The worst month on record was December 2022, when they dropped about 37%. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Shares are up roughly $40 since the Nov. 5 election. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     There is a connection between the 2022 and 2025 performance. December 2022 was just after Elon Musk closed his acquisition of social-media platform Twitter, which he renamed X. Then, investors were worried about Musk&apos;s time management and whether he could add another business to his quiver without the performance of his car company suffering. The upshot of that episode: Fears subsided and Tesla stock doubled in 2023. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Now, Musk is spending his time almost exclusively in Washington, D.C. Investors are, again, worried about time management. They are also concerned about whether the CEO&apos;s close association with President Donald Trump has turned off Tesla&apos;s traditional buyers, politically left-leaning consumers looking to go green. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Distraction risks are piling up, said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. &quot;Investors have patience but this is starting to tip the scale and it&apos;s weighing on shares along with brand issues related to Musk/Tesla,&quot; he added. &quot;Perception becomes reality on Wall Street.&quot; </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Investors are looking for anything that can turn the tide. And they&apos;d like Musk to try to change the perception. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Self-driving cars will be key. Tesla plans to launch an autonomous robo-taxi service in 2025. Tesla has applied for a permit to operate self-driving cars in California, Bloomberg reported Thursday. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Exactly what Tesla has applied for isn&apos;t clear. The company already holds a permit to test self-driving cars with a safety driver present in California. The California Department of Motor Vehicles said there hasn&apos;t been any application made for a self-driving license. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Tesla didn&apos;t respond to a request for comment about its permitting activities. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Investors hope they see self-driving Tesla vehicles on roads sooner than later. And now would be the time to work through regulatory processes in California if Tesla wants to start the service this year. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     This content was created by Barron&apos;s, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
