<p>&#10;  By Ed Carson </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Tesla hit fresh 2025 lows on Friday, extending a big February sell-off, but bouncing back at a key levelConcerns are mounting that CEO Elon Musk&apos;s high-profile role with the Trump administration is causing serious deterioration in the EV giant&apos;s brand image in the U.S. and Europe. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Tesla stock in recent days has broken below potential floors  at the 325-360 price range and the 300 level. It is now fighting to hold the 200-day moving average. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     TESLA EV NEWS </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     This week, Tesla has begun rolling out some more driver-assist functions in China, but not the Full Self-Driving in the U.S.. The early read on Tesla&apos;s latest features, which should improve with more training, is that it&apos;s not yet on par with systems from rival EV makers. Even with a full-fledged Level 2 system, Tesla may struggle to charge much in China for FSD, which goes for $8,000 in the U.S. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     On Wednesday, new Model Y deliveries began in China, with the U.S. and Europe to follow next month. The Model Y accounts for a large majority of Tesla&apos;s EV sales, so the refreshed version is the biggest possible growth catalyst for Tesla in 2025. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     So far this year, Tesla&apos;s Europe sales have tumbled vs. a year earlier, with indications of weak demand in the U.S. as well. Some of that reflects buyers waiting on the new Model Y, but Model 3 sales also are down sharply. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Analysts have slashed 2025 EPS estimates since the Q4 earnings report on Jan. 29. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Tesla filed an application late last year to launch a ride-hailing service in California, The Washington Post reported Thursday. That could eventually pave the way for a robotaxi service, but Tesla presumably would need a lengthy testing phase for that. Tesla has said it&apos;ll launch unsupervised robotaxis in Austin this June. However, the unofficial FSD tracker suggests the technology is a long way from true self driving. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     TESLA STOCK </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Tesla stock fell to 273.60 Friday morning, a fresh three-month low and undercutting the 200-day line. But shares bounced back for a 0.6% gain to 283.58. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Shares are down 30% in February, beginning with a gap below the 50-day line. TSLA stock is 42% below the Dec. 18 all-time high of 488.54. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     The market capitalization fell back below $1 trillion on Tuesday and was $907 billion as of Thursday&apos;s close. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     The 200-day moving average, now around 279, is a crucial support. TSLA has already undercut its 40-week moving average. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Below the 200-day line? The 264.86 buy point, which Tesla cleared in a Nov. 6 post-election gap up. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Tesla stock nearly round-tripping its huge postelection run is not a coincidence. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Shares spiked in November and to the Dec. 18 peak on optimism that Musk&apos;s close ties to President Donald Trump would benefit Tesla. But so far Musk&apos;s involvement and highly political social media posts appear to have caused further brand damage to the EV maker, especially among its core customer bases in the U.S. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Tesla stock has a 21-day average true range of just over 5%.  The ATR metric is available on IBD&apos;s MarketSurge charting tool. It gauges the characteristic breadth of a stock&apos;s behavior. Stocks that tend to make large jumps or dives in daily action, the kind that can trigger sell rules and shake investors out of a stock, have a high ATR. Stocks that tend to make more incremental moves have lower ATRs. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Please follow Ed Carson on  Threads at @edcarson1971 and X/Twitter at @IBD_ECarson  for stock market updates and more. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;      View this article at Investors.com </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-falling-support/ </p>&#10;<p>&#10;      Investor&apos;s Business Daily - Your edge in the stock market </p>&#10;<p>&#10;      This content was created by Investor&apos;s Business Daily, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
