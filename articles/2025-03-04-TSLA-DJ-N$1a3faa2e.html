<p>&#10;  Al Root </p>&#10;<p>&#10;  Tesla stock was dropping early Tuesday after falling in the previous session as investors considered the impact of a &quot;buyers strike&quot; on the electric vehicles maker. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Tesla stock was 0.2% lower in premarket trading at $284.13, while S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were flat and up 0.1%, respectively. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Tesla stock tried to rally on Monday, at the start of a new month. Shares were in the green early, but the market just didn&apos;t cooperate. The stock lost 2.8% while the Nasdaq Composite plunged 2.6% as investors weighed the impact of President Donald Trump&apos;s trade policies on the U.S. economy. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Tariffs of 25% on Canadian and Mexican imports go into effect on Tuesday. That has the potential to raise costs for all auto makers. Tesla assembles its cars for the North American market in the U.S., but parts come from elsewhere. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     The EV maker had an ignominious start to the month on Mar. 3 after the stock fell almost 30% in February.  Sales data showed the company underperformed the U.S., Europe, and China EV industry. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     In a Monday report, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas characterized it as a &quot;buyers&apos; strike,&quot; with CEO Elon Musk&apos;s increasingly political activity turning off core Tesla buyers -- politically left-leaning people looking to go green. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     The data have left investors looking for any new positives. The first potential one will be Chinese sales in February. Tesla doesn&apos;t report monthly or regional sales, but analysts and investors have numbers from industry associations. Tesla&apos;s Chinese results should be out in a couple of days. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Jonas isn&apos;t all that bothered by the sales decline. He doesn&apos;t view Tesla as just a car company. He sees it as an AI play. Tesla uses AI computing to train its cars to drive and train humanoid robots it hopes to start selling as soon as 2025. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     &quot;While the journey may be volatile and nonlinear, we believe 2025 will be a year where investors will continue to appreciate and value these existing and nascent industries of embodied AI where we believe Tesla has established a material competitive advantage,&quot; he wrote. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Jonas rates shares Buy and has a $430 price target for the stock. Only $86 of that price target is represented by the car business. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Overall, 47% of analysts covering the stock rate shares Buy. The average Buy-rating ratio for stocks in the S&amp;P 500 is about 55%. The average analyst price target for Tesla stock is about $379. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     This content was created by Barron&apos;s, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
