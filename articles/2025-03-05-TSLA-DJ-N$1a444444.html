<p>&#10;     1416 ET - It would take about two years for the automotive industry to adapt to tariffs and prices to stabilize, CarGurus estimates. In a report, the online auto marketplace says it expects the effect on car prices will be minimal if tariffs last for three months or less because there was a roughly 84-day supply of inventory at the end of February, &quot;and consumers are likely to have access to a solid selection of pre-tariff vehicles,&quot; CarGurus says. But the longer tariffs drag on, the larger the dent in new sales will be. If they continue past four months, car makers will have to start finding ways to adjust, potentially moving more automotive production to the U.S., CarGurus says.
