<p>&#10;  By Kit Norton </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     A key Tesla stock analyst returned a &quot;top pick&quot; designation to the EV giant late on Sunday after removing that status on Jan. 31 following a &quot;mostly disappointing&quot; fourth-quarter earnings report. Tesla stock has dropped about 28% since the end of January but rallied early Monday. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, a longtime Tesla bull, reinstated Tesla as his firm&apos;s &quot;top pick&quot; in U.S. autos on Sunday, noting that investors appear to be on a Tesla &quot;buyers&apos; strike.&quot; The result, declining 2025 vehicle deliveries, could create an &quot;attractive entry point to our preferred embodied AI name,&quot; the note said. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     &quot;While the journey may be volatile and nonlinear, we believe 2025 will be a year where investors will continue to appreciate and value these existing and nascent industries of embodied AI where we believe Tesla has established a material competitive advantage,&quot; Jonas wrote Sunday. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     POSSIBLE TESLA CATALYSTS </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     The Morgan Stanley analyst maintains a 430 price target on Tesla stock, representing nearly 50% upside compared to current trading levels, as well as a bull case for 800. Jonas wrote Sunday that &quot;embodied AI&quot; is the &quot;driver for upside&quot; on his 800 bull case. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     The analyst also believes potential Tesla stock catalysts include the scheduled June 2025 robotaxi service launch in Austin, a potential AI day, launches of lower-priced models in the second or third quarter as well as a &quot;potential&quot; third-generation Optimus humanoid robot unveil. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     TSLA swung 3.3% higher before Monday&apos;s stock market open. The stock sank more than 13% last week, but advanced 3.9% on Friday to 292.98. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Last week, Tesla began rolling out some more driver-assist functions in China, but not the Full Self-Driving in the U.S.. The early read on Tesla&apos;s latest features, which should improve with more training, is that it&apos;s not yet on par with systems from rival EV makers. Even with a full-fledged Level 2 system, Tesla may struggle to charge much in China for FSD, which goes for $8,000 in the U.S. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     On Wednesday, new Model Y deliveries began in China, with the U.S. and Europe to follow next month. The Model Y accounts for a large majority of Tesla&apos;s EV sales, so the refreshed version is the biggest possible growth catalyst for Tesla in 2025. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     TESLA STOCK PERFORMANCE </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Tesla hit fresh 2025 lows on Friday, but rebounded at a key level. Concerns are mounting that Chief Executive Elon Musk&apos;s high-profile role with the Trump administration is causing serious deterioration in the EV giant&apos;s brand image in the U.S. and Europe. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Tesla stock in recent days broke below potential floors at the 325-360 price range and the 300 level. It is now fighting to hold the 200-day moving average. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     The stock fell as low as 273.60 on Friday morning, marking a new three-month low and undercutting the 200-day line. However, TSLA shares bounced back for a 3.9% gain, snapping a six-session slide. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Shares dived 27.6% in February, beginning with a gap below the 50-day moving average. TSLA stock is 40% below the Dec. 18 all-time high of 488.54. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     The market capitalization fell back below $1 trillion on Feb. 25 and was $942 billion as of Friday&apos;s close. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     The 200-day moving average, now around 279, is crucial level of technical support. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     How To Buy Stocks </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Tesla stock has a 21-day average true range of just over 5%. The ATR metric is available on IBD&apos;s MarketSurge charting tool. It gauges the characteristic breadth of a stock&apos;s behavior. Stocks that tend to make large jumps or dives in daily action, the kind that can trigger sell rules and shake investors out of a stock, have a high ATR. Stocks that tend to make more incremental moves have lower ATRs. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Tesla stock ranks fifth in the 35-stock IBD Auto Manufacturers industry group. The stock has an 68 Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99. Shares also have a 91 Relative Strength Rating and an 84 EPS Rating. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Please follow Kit Norton on X @KitNorton for more coverage. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     YOU MAY ALSO LIKE: </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Is Tesla Stock A Buy Or A Sell? </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Get Full Access To IBD Stock Lists And Ratings </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Learning How To Pick Great Stocks?
