<p>&#10;  Al Root </p>&#10;<p>&#10;  Electric-vehicle charging company Wallbox is trying to innovate its way out of a problem linked to President Donald Trump. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Investors are encouraged by the effort. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Tuesday, Wallbox launched its latest &quot;Quasar 2&quot; charger for Kia EV9 owners. It&apos;s an interesting product. It helps turn a Kia into a backup generator. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     &quot;This cutting-edge technology allows eligible EV9 owners and lessees to take control of their energy consumption and costs, and provides the possibility of power backup during electrical outages,&quot; said CEO Enric Asuncion in a news release. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     The Wallbox power-recovery unit is needed to make the system work. The Kia EV9 has hardware and software that let the charger take power back out of the car. It wouldn&apos;t work with many Teslas, though Tesla has said its vehicles would support bidirectional charging in 2025, and Cybertrucks have a Powershare feature that lets them, well, share power. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Tesla didn&apos;t respond to a request for comment about the status of its bidirectional charging. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Wallbox&apos;s unit and the charger will cost owners about $6,500, excluding taxes and installation. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     A Kia EV9 has a base battery-pack size of about 75 kilowatt-hours. That is enough to power a U.S. home for about three days, based on average electricity usage. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Wallbox stock was up in early trading, but gains didn&apos;t last as a tariff-related selloff took most stocks down. Wallbox shares were down 2.6% at 37 cents a share, while the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.6% and 1.5%, respectively. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     The brief bump in the stock price likely was little comfort for investors. EV charging has been tough lately. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Wallbox shares dropped 12.5% on Monday. Coming into Tuesday trading, Wallbox stock was down more than 60% since the Nov. 5 presidential election. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Trump has promised to eliminate spending and incentives tied to EVs started by former President Joe Biden, which has spelled disaster for several EV-charging stocks. Shares of ChargePoint, EVGo, and Blink Charging were down about 55% on average since the election. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Life will be harder for EV-charging companies without federal support. They will have to carve out a niche with low costs and unique innovations, just as Wallbox is trying to do. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     This content was created by Barron&apos;s, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
