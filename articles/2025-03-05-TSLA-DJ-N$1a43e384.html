<p>&#10;     1133 ET - President Trump&apos;s tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico could lead to auto-industry production slowdowns and even widespread stoppages, Morningstar DBRS&apos;s Robert Streda suggests. He believes if production disruptions persist over an extended period, it could result in a sizable associated cash burn and erosion of liquidity and could place additional pressure on the credit ratings of some original equipment manufacturers. As it now stands, Morningstar expects the credit ratings of most auto manufacturers will be resilient to the tariffs, though those with a significant dependence on North America for earnings and with a material manufacturing footprint in Mexico and Canada could eventually be subject to negative rating actions.
