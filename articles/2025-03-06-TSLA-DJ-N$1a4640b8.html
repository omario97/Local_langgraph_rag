<p>&#10;  By Joe Woelfel </p>&#10;<p>&#10;  Stock futures were falling Thursday after Wall Street rallied broadly following the White House&apos;s move to provide auto makers a one-month exemption from tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     These stocks were poised to make moves Thursday: </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     General Motors was down 1.3%, Ford Motor fell 1.1%, and Jeep maker Stellantis declined 1.9% after shares of the Big Three auto companies surged Wednesday. They were given a reprieve from the tariffs &quot;so they are not at an economic disadvantage,&quot; White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters. The delay came after President Donald Trump spoke with representatives from the auto makers. &quot;We are going to give a one-month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA,&quot; Leavitt said. USMCA is the acronym for the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a trade deal Trump negotiated during his first term. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Electric-vehicle maker Tesla, meanwhile, was falling 1.8% in premarket trading after closing with a gain of 2.6% in the previous session. Tesla sales have been declining across the globe with anger growing over the political activities of CEO Elon Musk.

Analysts see adjusted profit of $2.90 a share on revenue of $2.64 billion. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     U.S.-listed shares of JD.com rose 6.2% after the Chinese online retailer&apos;s fourth-quarter earnings better than analysts&apos; expectations.
