<p>&#10;  By Joe Woelfel </p>&#10;<p>&#10;  Stock futures were wavering Wednesday after giving up gains from the premarket session after a weaker-than-expected U.S. private-employment report for February. Futures had been solidly higher after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick signaled the U.S. may be willing to compromise with its neighbors on tariffs. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     These stocks were poised to make moves Wednesday: </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     CrowdStrike Holdings posted fourth-quarter adjusted earnings and revenue that beat Wall Street estimates but the cybersecurity company&apos;s outlooks for its fiscal first quarter and all of fiscal 2026 were well below expectations.

The stock declined 9.6%. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Defense contractor AeroVironment was plunging 18% after issuing weak fiscal-year guidance. The company expects revenue of $780 million to $795 million, down from prior guidance of about $810 million and below Wall Street estimates of $820 million. Adjusted earnings were forecast at $2.92 to $3.13 a share, below analysts&apos; expectations of $3.43.

It has finished lower eight of the past nine trading sessions. The issues for investors include tariffs, weak Chinese sales, and the impact of a &quot;buyer&apos;s strike&quot; on the company. Data released Wednesday, meanwhile, showed that vehicle registrations fell 76% in February in Germany, Europe&apos;s largest economy.. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     General Motors rose 4.4%, Ford Motor gained 2.9%, and Stellantis was up 7% after Lutnick hinted on a tariffs compromise.

The stock has risen three of the past five trading sessions but has fallen more than 13% since Nvidia reported quarterly earnings last week. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Super Micro Computer also bucked a sinking stock market to close Tuesday up 8.5%, snapping a three-session losing streak. It fell 13% on Monday on Trump&apos;s warning that tariffs were coming and the apparent unwinding of the artificial-intelligence trade.  Super Micro rose 1% on Wednesday. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Palantir Technologies rose 0.1% to $84.48. Analysts at William Blair upgraded shares of the data-analytics company to Market Perform from Underperform without a price target. The analysts said the higher rating on followed &quot;the 33% DOGE-driven selloff from $125 to $84 over the past three weeks.&quot; William Blair said that while valuation remained &quot;frothy with potential downside risk of greater than 40% on government contract delays, there have been positive developments.&quot; </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Moderna rose 11% after the vaccine maker disclosed that Chief Executive Stephane Bancel bought about $5 million of common stock on March 3, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Foot Locker rose 6.7% after the sneaker and athletic-wear retailer posted fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of 86 cents a share, beating analysts&apos; forecasts of 72 cents.
