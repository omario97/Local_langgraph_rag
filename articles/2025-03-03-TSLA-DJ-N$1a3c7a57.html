<p>&#10;  By Joe Woelfel </p>&#10;<p>&#10;  Stock futures were rising Monday after equities rallied Friday on the last day of February, a month that saw the S&amp;P 500 drop 1.4%. A focus for traders will be the implementation of fresh tariffs on major trading partners Canada and Mexico during the week and a doubling of levies on China. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     These stocks were poised to make moves Monday: </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Intel shares were rising 6.1% ollowing a Reuters report that said chip designers Nvidia and Broadcom  both were running tests on Intel&apos;s 18A manufacturing process. Intel repeatedly has claimed that its 18A process was poised to give it a technological lead in chip manufacturing against dominant rival  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Nvidia, meanwhile, was falling 0.8%. The Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese buyers have been circumventing U.S. export controls to order the company&apos;s latest artificial-intelligence chips despite the restrictions. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Super Micro Computer rose 3.6%. The maker of artificial-intelligence servers said Friday it will be building its third campus in California&apos;s Silicon Valley. Plans call for the campus, with construction expected to start this year, to be nearly 3 million square feet. The expansion, Super Micro said, would accelerate production of liquid-cooled services for data center, and create new jobs. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     U.S.-listed shares of NIO were down 2%, XPeng fell 4.9%, and Li Auto dropped 7.7% even as the three Chinese electric-vehicle makers delivered almost 70,000 vehicles in February, up 112% year over year. NIO&apos;s deliveries jumped 62% last month from a year earlier, XPeng&apos;s deliveries soared 570% to 30,453, boosted by sales of its relatively new P7+ and MONA MO3 models, and Li Auto&apos;s deliveries rose 30%. The sales jumps show that demand for electric cars in China, the world&apos;s second-largest economy, remains strong and is a positive for any EV maker, including Tesla. The U.S. electric-vehicle company, however, has been struggling amid fierce competition. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Tesla rose 2.8% in premarket trading. The stock rose 3.9% on Friday and snapped a six-session losing streak. February was Tesla&apos;s second-worst month ever, falling 28%. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, in a post on X over the weekend, said he believes Tesla&apos;s profit can rise 1,000% in the coming five years, adding that it &quot;will require outstanding execution.&quot; </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     MicroStrategy jumped 14%, Coinbase was up 9.4%, and Robinhood Markets gained 9.1% as the cryptocurrency-linked stocks followed Bitcoin higher after President Donald Trump said the world&apos;s largest crypto, along with Ethereum,  Ripple, Solana, and Cardano would be part of a Crypto Strategic Reserve. In a post Truth Social post, Trump said his executive order would &quot;move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL and ADA. I will make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World.&quot; He later added Bitcoin, which has risen 9% to $93,458 over the past 24 hours, and Ethereum in a follow-up post. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     European defense stocks such as Rheinmetall, up 13%, and BAE Systems, up 14%, traded higher overseas after European leaders over the weekend discussed plans to spend more on weapons as they work to forge a Ukraine peace plan. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Southwest Airlines fell 2.1% to $30.40. Analysts at J.P. Morgan downgraded shares of the airline to Underweight from Neutral. They left their price target unchanged at $25. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Chipotle Mexican Grill was rising 2.4% to $55.25 after the restaurant chain was upgraded to Overweight from Equal Weight at Morgan Stanley and the price target was boosted to from $65. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Allegro MicroSystems jumped 15% after Bloomberg reported the semiconductor-technology company was being pursued for a takeover by On Semiconductor. Allegro also could see additional suitors emerge, said the report, which cited people familiar with the matter. ON Semi fell 1.1%. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Earnings reports are expected Monday from  Okta and GitLab. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Reports are expected later in the week from Target, Marvell Technology, Broadcom, Costco Wholesale, JD.com, CrowdStrike Holdings, Zscaler, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, MongoDB, AutoZone, On Holding, Best Buy, AST SpaceMobile, Plug Power, Nordstrom, Kroger, Ross Stores, Campbell&apos;s, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Gap, and Macy&apos;s. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Write to Joe Woelfel at  joseph.woelfel@barrons.com </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     This content was created by Barron&apos;s, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
