<p>&#10;  By Joe Woelfel, Mackenzie Tatananni, and Connor Smith </p>&#10;<p>&#10;  Stocks slid on Tuesday after President Donald Trump&apos;s 25% tax on imports from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods went into effect. The S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.6% and 1.2%, respectively, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.4% but didn&apos;t close in correction territory. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     These stocks made moving Tuesday: </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Electric-vehicle maker Tesla  was down 4.4%, following a 2.8% drop on Monday, as Trump&apos;s tariffs announcement sent Wall Street reeling. Tesla assembles all its vehicles for the domestic market in the U.S., but about 15% of the parts in a Model Y sold in the U.S. come from Mexico. Some parts come from Canada as well, though an exact amount is harder to pin down. Meanwhile, preliminary data from the China Passenger Car Association said Tesla&apos;s sales of electric vehicles made in China dropped 49.2% in February. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     General Motors was down 4.6%, Ford Motor fell 2.8%, and Jeep maker Stellantis declined 4.4% as the Trump administration enacted tariffs. Ford CEO Jim Farley has said the tariffs threaten to wipe out billions of dollars in auto-industry profits as the levies have the potential to raise prices for car buyers. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Shares of Nvidia  rose 1.7% to $115.99 after the leading maker of artificial-intelligence chips dropped 8.7% on Monday to $114.06 -- the stock&apos;s lowest close since mid-September 2024 -- on tariff worries. Coming into Tuesday, Nvidia has closed lower for five of the past trading sessions. Its market cap has dropped below $3 trillion. Analysts at Mizuho wrote that Nvidia has slumped for a number of reasons, including continued concerns about potential restrictions on exports of its AI hardware amid reports that advanced chips have been reaching China despite U.S. sanctions. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     United Airlines Holdings fell 6%, Delta Air Lines  slumped 6.4%, and cruise companies such as Royal Caribbean Group, down 5.9%, and Carnival, down 5.8%, were tumbling on worries that tariffs would crimp travel demand. The U.S. Global Jets exchange-traded fund fell 3.4%. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Wells Fargo fell 4.8%, JPMorgan Chase declined 4%, and Morgan Stanley was off 5.7%. Investors appeared to be weighing not just the impact of tariffs but concerns about a broader economic slowdown, which could crimp demand for loans and other banking services and products. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Walgreens Boots Alliance rose 5.6% to $10.84 after The Wall Street Journal reported the drugstore chain was nearing a deal with private-equity firm Sycamore Partners to be acquired for around $10 billion. The Journal report, which cited people familiar with the matter, said a share price of $11.30 to $11.40 had been discussed, and the aim was to complete the deal as soon as Thursday. The agreement would take Walgreens private. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Target was down 3%. Strong holiday demand for discretionary items helped the retailer beat fourth-quarter earnings expectations, but Target said uncertainty over consumer demand and tariffs will weigh on the current quarter&apos;s performance. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Super Micro Computer rose 8.5% Tuesday, after the maker of AI servers dropped 13% on Monday. The stock has declined 29% over the last three trading sessions. Super Micro has suffered from a hangover after an initial celebration last week when it  avoided delisting and met its compliance deadline for submitting financial filings. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Best Buy, the electronics retailer, reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that topped Wall Street forecasts. The stock, however, declined 13%. Best Buy said it expects fiscal 2026 revenue in the range of $41.4 billion to $42.2 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting $41.8 billion. The company also forecast adjusted earnings between $6.20 and $6.60 a share. Analysts were expecting closer to the high end of that range, at $6.58. Management also warned consumers would likely foot the bill for Trump&apos;s tariffs. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Okta jumped 24% after the provider of cloud-based software and identity-access solutions reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and revenue, and said it anticipates fiscal first-quarter revenue of $678 million to $680 million, higher than Wall Street predictions of $670 million. &quot;We&apos;re optimistic about FY 26, but also it&apos;s pretty early in the year,&quot; Chief Executive Todd McKinnon told Barron&apos;s in an interview. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     SoundHound AI fell 5.9% after the artificial-intelligence voice technology company said it was delaying its 10-K filing. SoundHound &quot;requires additional time to prepare the financial statements and the accompanying notes&quot; disclosed in the annual report, due to the complexity of accounting for two separate acquisitions that happened last year, the company said in a regulatory filing. The company expects to file no later than March 18. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Software firm GitLab swung to a profit as fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of 33 cents a share beat analysts&apos; expectations for 23 cents. Revenue rose 29% to $211.4 million and topped estimates. For fiscal 2026, GitLab said it expects adjusted earnings per share of 68 cents to 72 cents, below Wall Street forecasts for 80 cents, and revenue of $936 million to $942 million, compared with analysts&apos; expectations for $938.9 million. Shares rose 12%. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Earnings reports were expected after the closing bell Tuesday from CrowdStrike Holdings, Ross Stores, and Box Inc. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Write to Joe Woelfel at  joseph.woelfel@barrons.com and Mackenzie Tatananni at mackenzie.tatananni@barrons.com </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     This content was created by Barron&apos;s, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
