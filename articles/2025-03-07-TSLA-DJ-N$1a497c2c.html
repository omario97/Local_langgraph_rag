<p>&#10;  Al Root </p>&#10;<p>&#10;  Tesla stock was falling in premarket trading after catching an unusual upgrade and a table-pounding call from a long-time bullish analyst. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     At this point, any good news is welcome news for Tesla investors. After an incredible run, shares of the electric-vehicle maker have been mired in a brutal slump. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Tesla stock was down 0.6% in premarket trading Friday at $261.82, while S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were rising 0.3% and 0.1%, respectively. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     The upgrade should help shares. TD Cowen analyst Itay Michaeli late Thursday upgraded shares to Buy from Hold. TD Cowen&apos;s price target jumped to $388 a share from $180. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     The target price jumped a whopping $208. Michaeli didn&apos;t exactly raise his target price that much. He came over from Citi where he rated Tesla shares Hold, but had a recent price target of $258. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Michaeli took over coverage at TD Cowen from Jeff Osborne. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     However it happened, it&apos;s an upgrade and target price bump. &quot;There are merits to both the bull and bear cases,&quot; wrote Michaeli. &quot;While there is no shortage of challenges this year ... the list of potential game-changing level catalysts across, EV, autonomous vehicles, and robotics are robust enough to tilt risk/reward favorably.&quot; </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     The challenges are the potential removal of federal EV purchase tax credits worth up to $7,500, President Donals Trump&apos;s import tariffs, which raise Tesla&apos;s parts costs, and more EV competition. The positives are a new lower-priced EV due to be launched around mid-year, a self-driving robotaxi business expected by year-end, and a humanoid robotics business Tesla plans to ramp up in 2026. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Along with the upgrade, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives put Tesla stock on his firm&apos;s &quot;best ideas&quot; list as a &quot;table pounder.&quot; A table pounder is a stock in which an has a strong conviction. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     &quot;This is a gut check moment for the Tesla bulls (including ourselves) after this massive selloff in Tesla shares with fears mounting,&quot; Ives wrote in a note. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Coming into Friday, Tesla stock has fallen about 46% since hitting an all-time intraday high of $488.54 on Dec. 18. Shares rocketed by some $237 after the Nov. 5 election. Initially, investors expected CEO Elon Musk&apos;s proximity to the president to benefit Tesla. Lately, investors have worried that Musk&apos;s political activities could be hurting sales. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     &quot;While the DOGE/Trump Musk iron clad partnership has created major brand worries for Tesla ... we estimate less than 5% of Tesla sales globally are at risk from these issues,&quot; added Wedbush&apos;s Ives. &quot;We expect Musk will better balance his time between DOGE and Tesla/SpaceX over the course of 2025.&quot; Ives kept his Buy rating and $550 price target on the stock. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     After Michaeli&apos;s upgrade, 49% of analysts covering the stock rate shares Buy, according to FactSet. The average Buy-rating ratio for stocks in the S&amp;P 500 is about 55%. The average analyst price target for Tesla stock is about $379 a share. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Write to Al Root at  allen.root@dowjones.com </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     This content was created by Barron&apos;s, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
