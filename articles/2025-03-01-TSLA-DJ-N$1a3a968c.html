<p>&#10;  Al Root </p>&#10;<p>&#10;  Chinese electric vehicle makers NIO, XPeng, and Li Auto turned in another strong month of sales. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     The February sales figures show that demand for electric cars in the world&apos;s second-largest economy remains strong, a positive for any EV maker, including  Tesla. Competition, however, remains fierce. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Saturday, NIO reported 13,192 deliveries in February, up 62% year over year. Li delivered 26,263 vehicles, up 30% year over year. XPeng was even stronger: It delivered 30,453 vehicles, up 570% year over year, boosted by sales of its relatively new P7+ and MONA MO3 models. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Combined, the three delivered almost 70,000 vehicles, up 112% year over year. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     EV penetration of new car sales in February should land at 53% in China, Citi analyst Jeff Chung estimated in a recent report. That is for both all-electric cars and plug-in hybrids. March penetration could be as high as 65%, he projects. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     New EV launches from BYD, Geely, and Changan will boost numbers. The Chinese marketplace remains saturated with new EVs. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     More competition isn&apos;t what Tesla investors want to hear. The EV maker sold roughly 34,000 cars to Chinese buyers in January, down about 12% year over year, according to the China Passenger Car Association. Tesla doesn&apos;t report monthly or regional sales volumes. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Investors want to see a sales rebound for Tesla. January numbers from the company run by Elon Musk around the globe weren&apos;t positive. According to industry data providers, sales in the U.S. and Europe fell roughly 13% and 45%, respectively. Those declines were despite overall EV growth in both regions. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Tesla is launching new driver assistance features in China and a new version of its Model Y worldwide to help boost sales. If growth fails to materialize, it will feed fears that Musk&apos;s political activities in Washington, D.C., are hurting sales. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Musk is the head of President Donald Trump&apos;s so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Traditionally, Tesla buyers have been left-leaning politically. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     If sales continue to dip in February and the coming months, investors might see further evidence that Musk&apos;s political turn has damaged the brand. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Through Friday trading, Tesla stock was down about 27% year to date, while the S&amp;P 500 was about 1%. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     This content was created by Barron&apos;s, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
