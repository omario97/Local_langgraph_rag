<p>&#10;  By Al Root </p>&#10;<p>&#10;  While Elon Musk presides over his chaotic restructuring of the U.S. government, Tesla investors are trying to get their bearings. On Tuesday, shares plummeted 8.4% after disappointing sales data from Europe fed the belief that Musk&apos;s political activities were hurting demand. Tesla sold only 9,900 cars in January in Europe, down 45% from the prior January, even as European electric-vehicle sales rose 37%. Tesla&apos;s market cap fell below a trillion dollars. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     That was just the latest shock. The stock is down 37% from its record closing high of $480 on Dec. 17, shedding $570 billion in market value, and is off 29% since Donald Trump&apos;s Jan. 20 inauguration. It has cost Musk some $140 billion in net worth. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     The good news is relative. Shares are up 27% since the company&apos;s Oct. 10 Robotaxi Day, when Tesla talked up plans for a self-driving taxi in 2025. Hopes were fueled by the belief that Trump would speed U.S. self-driving efforts. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Fairlead Strategies market technician Will Tamplin said Tesla stock had support at about $315, which the stock breached on Tuesday. Tamplin isn&apos;t making a fundamental call -- he&apos;s looking at charts to see when investors have bought and sold. Support represents where investors have bought stock; falling below support suggests investors&apos; thinking has changed. CappThesis founder Frank Cappelleri notes additional support for Tesla at $275, near the stock&apos;s 200-day moving average. The stock closed on Friday at $293. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Last Week </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Markets </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Germany&apos;s Christian Democrats, led by Friedrich Merz, won federal elections; coalition talks began on Friday.
