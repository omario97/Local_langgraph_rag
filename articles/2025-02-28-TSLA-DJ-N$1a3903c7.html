<p>&#10;  By Francesca Fontana </p>&#10;<p>&#10;  The Score is a weekly review of the biggest stock moves and the news that drove them. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Home Depot </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Home Depot delivered a better-than-expected quarter. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     The home-improvement retailer beat Wall Street expectations for quarterly sales and profit, but offered cautious guidance as higher interest rates continue to pressure big-ticket purchases. The company also said it would increase its quarterly dividend to $2.30 a share. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Home Depot said demand was strong for appliances and building materials, but weaker for discretionary projects such as kitchen and bathroom remodels, for which consumers typically use financing. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Rival Lowe&apos;s also posted better-than-expected quarterly results during the week. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Home Depot shares rallied 2.8% Tuesday. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Tesla </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Is Elon Musk more focused on DOGE than on Tesla? </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     That&apos;s the worry of some investors and analysts helping drive the electric-car maker&apos;s latest selloff. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     New data published Tuesday showed that Tesla had a terrible January in Europe, as its sales fell 45% in the region compared with a year earlier. Possible factors behind the slide include Chief Executive Musk&apos;s political activism and focus on his role at the Department of Government Efficiency, rising EV competition from Volkswagen and other legacy brands, and a pullback after a sales push in December. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     The news on Tuesday sent the company&apos;s market capitalization below $1 trillion for the first time since mid-November. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Tesla shares dropped 8.4% Tuesday. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Stellantis </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     The carmaker behind Jeep, Ram and other brands may still have some bumps in the road ahead. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Stellantis gave a cautious outlook for growth and profitability this year, but its guidance disappointed. The company also said revenue fell 17% and shipments were down 12% in 2024, mainly due to temporary gaps in its product lineup. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Later in the week, Stellantis and other European auto stocks fell in response to President Trump&apos;s latest tariff threats against the European Union. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Stellantis shares lost 5.3% Wednesday. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Anheuser-Busch InBev </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Shares of the world&apos;s largest brewer bubbled higher on Wednesday. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     AB InBev -- whose brands include Budweiser, Stella Artois and Michelob Ultra -- said that higher U.S. prices helped boost its quarterly revenue and profit. Its organic revenue growth topped analysts&apos; forecasts. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     The company said it continued to win market share in the U.S. in the fourth quarter and recovered from a boycott that hammered them for more than a year. The boycott began in the spring of 2023, after transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney posted an Instagram video about a personalized beer can the brand had sent her as a gift. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     American depositary shares of AB InBev rallied 7.2% Wednesday. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Nvidia </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Nvidia&apos;s  blockbuster earnings weren&apos;t enough for Wall Street. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     The chip maker&apos;s stock fell on Thursday, despite Wednesday&apos;s report that showed sharply rising sales and profit in its latest quarter. Nvidia brought in $11 billion of revenue from its new Blackwell artificial-intelligence chips. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     The results showed spending on Nvidia&apos;s chips continues to soar despite jitters about the outlook for the AI boom. In January, the threat of competition from Chinese AI developer DeepSeek spooked Nvidia investors and rattled markets. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Analysts blamed the stock&apos;s fall on narrower profit margins and worry about Nvidia&apos;s sales in China. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Nvidia shares slid 8.5% Thursday. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     HP </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     HP shares powered down after the computer maker&apos;s weak outlook and layoff announcements. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     The company late Thursday posted higher revenue in its fiscal first quarter, but said the effects of tariffs would drag on its second-quarter results. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     HP also said it would lay off up to 2,000 more employees as part of a continuing cost-cutting plan, bringing the total number of job cuts under the restructuring to as many as 9,000. First announced in November 2022, HP&apos;s &quot;Future Now&quot; plan initially called for workforce cuts of about 7,000 employees. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     HP shares fell 6.8% Friday. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Our weekly markets news roundup is now part of the WSJ&apos;s What&apos;s News podcast.
