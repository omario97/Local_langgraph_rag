<p>&#10;     Some board members and one executive have told people they see Musk&apos;s close relationship with the president as a positive, giving him influence over issues that could benefit the company longer term, according to people familiar with the conversations. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Two Tesla board members and some senior executives have expressed support publicly for Musk&apos;s political involvement and some of the policies he has embraced. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Some Tesla owners, though, have said the controversy has gotten to be too much. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Bob Eckert, who described himself as a onetime Musk fan, said his desire to sell his 2021 Model Y had been building since Trump&apos;s inauguration. &quot;As the days and weeks went on, we realized it was not something we could afford to support, even if we lost money,&quot; he said. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     He unloaded his vehicle in February, taking a $3,000 financial hit because he owed more on his loan than the car was worth, replacing it with an electric Ford Mustang Mach-E. The Ford dealer offered him 0% financing and a $1,000 cash bonus for defecting from Tesla. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Larry Broughton, a 76-year-old retired mortgage banker from Houston, said he was watching the news about Musk&apos;s plans for the DOGE in early January and decided he no longer wanted the two Cybertrucks he had ordered. He walked to his office and canceled his reservations. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     &quot;As soon as he started doing all this stuff that Trump wanted him to do, I didn&apos;t want to be a part of it,&quot; Broughton said. &quot;I actually own some Tesla stock, and I&apos;m thinking of selling that as well.&quot; </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Write to Becky Peterson at becky.peterson@wsj.com and Sean McLain at sean.mclain@wsj.com </p>&#10;<p>&#10;  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (March 7, 2025). </p>&#10;<pre>&#10; </pre>&#10;<p>&#10;  (END) Dow Jones Newswires</p>&#10;<p>&#10;  March 07, 2025 02:32 ET (07:32 GMT)</p>&#10;<p>&#10; Copyright (c) 2025 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.</p>&#10;&#10;<br><br>&#10;<div><p>The statements in this document shall not be considered as an objective or independent explanation of the matters.
