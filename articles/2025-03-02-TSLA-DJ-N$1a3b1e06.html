<p>&#10;  Al Root </p>&#10;<p>&#10;  There was good and not so good news for Tesla investors over the weekend. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     First, the good. Tesla CEO Elon Musk took to X to discuss Tesla earnings. Musk believes Tesla&apos;s profit can rise 1,000% in the coming five years, adding &quot;It will require outstanding execution.&quot; </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Musk&apos;s comment was made in response to a tweet that pointed out Wall Street projections have Tesla earnings roughly $9 a share in 2029 from less than $2.90 in 2023, up about 300%. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     It isn&apos;t guidance; it&apos;s a goal. Investors will have to wait until Monday to see if the comment moves Tesla stock. For now, they can consider what it means for Tesla&apos;s share price. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     &quot;A 10x increase in Tesla earnings translates&quot; into a $714 stock price today, says Future Fund Active ETF co-founder and Tesla shareholder Gary Black, adding about the earnings growth &quot;that&apos;s Elon&apos;s assumption not ours.&quot; </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Black&apos;s math is relatively straightforward. The 10x increase means earnings between $24 and $25 a share in 2025. The stock might trade for about 50 times earnings, putting the 2029 price at about $1,200. Discounting back at about 14% gets Black to his $714 figure. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     If nothing else, it explains why Tesla investors are currently willing to pay about 100 times estimated 2025 earnings for shares. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     As for what will drive earnings up 1,000%, Musk believes self-driving technology will do it. Tesla plans to launch a self-driving robotaxi service in 2025. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Self-driving features are also the source of not-so-good news. Tesla recently released higher-level self-driving features in China and charges Chinese buyers more than $8,000 for the features. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     One early review is disappointing. Tesla&apos;s new features were &quot;met with not-so-exciting feedback initially with (1) much higher needs on manual takeovers; (2) more traffic violation cases,&quot; wrote Citi analyst Jeff Chung in a recent report. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Tesla uses AI computers to train its systems to drive. Training in China has been a challenge for the company. &quot;We do have some challenges [in China] because they [won&apos;t] allow us to transfer training video outside of China. And then the U.S. government won&apos;t let us do training in China, &quot; said Musk on his company&apos;s fourth quarter earnings conference call in January. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     &quot;Tesla has reportedly sent engineers from the U.S. to China in early Feb. for local deployment of [driver assistance] and optimization of its algorithms,&quot; added Chung. He expects Tesla&apos;s features to improve over time. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     They better or else Tesla will have a tough time selling the system for more than $8,000. Chinese EV leader BYD doesn&apos;t charge anything extra for its driver assistance products. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     The best news for Tesla investors might be that both of these tidbits are about Tesla&apos;s business and stock market fundamentals instead of Musk&apos;s political activities, which investors have recently worried are hurting sales. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Tesla&apos;s January sales fell in the U.S., Europe, and China compared with a year ago. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Falling sales weighed on investor sentiment in February. Shares dropped 28% for the month, leaving them down about 27% year to date. The S&amp;P 500 was up about 1%. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     This content was created by Barron&apos;s, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
