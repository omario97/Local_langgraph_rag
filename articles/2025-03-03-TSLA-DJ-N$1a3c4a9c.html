<p>&#10;  By Ed Carson </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Tesla is one of the worst performers on the S&amp;P 500 in 2025, after spiking late last year. But Tesla stock is extremely expensive by a price-to-earnings metric. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     When a stock sells off hard, investors and Wall Street analysts will often tout it as a buy, citing much-cheaper valuations. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Through February, Tesla stock has plunged 27.45% ---- and 40% from the Dec. 18 all-time high ---- making it the fourth worst performer on the S&amp;P 500 so far this year. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     But Tesla&apos;s forward price-to-earnings ratio remains in the triple digits. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     TESLA STOCK VALUATION </p>&#10;<pre>&#10; &#10;Date         Tesla stock price  2025 EPS estimate  2025 P-E ratio &#10;12/30/2022              123.18              $7.93            15.5 &#10;3/31/2023               207.46              $6.95            29.8 &#10;9/29/2023               250.22              $6.20            40.4 &#10;10/31/2023              200.84              $5.56            36.1 &#10;11/30/2023              240.08              $5.42            44.3 &#10;12/29/2023              248.48              $5.29              47 &#10;1/31/2024               187.29              $4.36            42.9 &#10;2/29/2024               201.88              $4.24            47.6 &#10;3/28/2024               175.79              $3.91              45 &#10;4/30/2024               183.28              $3.35            54.7 &#10;5/31/2024               178.08              $3.32            53.7 &#10;6/28/2024               197.88              $3.28            60.3 &#10;7/31/2024               232.07              $3.19            72.7 &#10;8/31/2024               214.11              $3.18            67.4 &#10;9/30/2024               261.63              $3.19            81.9 &#10;10/31/2024              249.85              $3.30            75.6 &#10;11/30/2024              345.16              $3.34           103.3 &#10;12/31/2024              403.84              $3.34           120.9 &#10;1/31/2025                404.6              $3.04           133.3 &#10;2/28/2025               292.98              $2.90             101 </pre>&#10;<p>&#10;     Source: FactSet </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Tesla stock bottomed in spring 2024 but really took after the Q3 earnings report in late October and especially following Donald Trump&apos;s election victory on Nov. 5. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Elon Musk made bullish comments about the EV business on the Q3 earnings call, predicting 2024 delivery growth and 20%-30% growth in 2025. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Along with hopes that Musk&apos;s close Trump ties would benefit the company significantly, Tesla stock skyrocketed. From Oct. 23, when Tesla reported Q3 results, shares shot up 130% to a record 488.54 on Dec. 18. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Analysts, which had been cutting 2025 EPS forecasts for the prior two years, bumped up targets somewhat, to $3.34 a share late last year. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Still, Tesla&apos;s forward price to earnings shot up from 53.7 on May 31 to 75.6 on Oct. 31, 120.9 on Dec. 31 and finally 133.3 on Jan. 31. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     On a monthly basis, the TSLA stock price only rose a fraction in January. But the  forward P-E kept rising because earnings estimates began falling again. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     As it turned out Tesla ended up reporting a slim delivery decline last year. On the Q4 earnings call in late January, Tesla predicted some delivery growth, not 20%-30%. Since then, concerns have grown that deliveries will slide for a second straight year. If so, earnings estimates have a lot further to fall. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Tesla stock sold off 27.6% last month, but rebounded from the 200-day line on Feb. 28 and was signaling further gains on Monday. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Analysts continued to trim 2025 estimates slightly last month, but Tesla&apos;s forward P-E ratio is down to 101 due to the lower share price. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Still, Tesla&apos;s valuation is far above that of other profitable automakers. Toyota Motor has a forward P-E ratio of 8. General Motors has a forward P-E ratio of 4. Among EV players, Li Auto has a forward P-E ratio of 19. EV giant BYD has a forward P-E ratio of 20. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Ferrari is the only one even vaguely close to Tesla, with a forward P-E of 49. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     S P 500 STOCKS: BIGGEST LOSERS </p>&#10;<pre>&#10; &#10;Company                        Ticker   2025 stock price decline &#10;Edison International           EIX                        31.80% &#10;Deckers Outdoor                DECK                       31.38% &#10;West Pharmaceutical Services   WST                        29.07% &#10;Tesla                          TSLA                       27.45% &#10;Celanse                        CE                         26.40% </pre>&#10;<p>&#10;     TESLA STOCK BULL CASE </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     The vast majority of Tesla stock&apos;s valuation reflects optimism surrounding self-driving, robotics and artificial intelligence. A growing number of analysts explicit peg most of their TSLA stock price targets on these moonshots. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     One of those analysts, Morgan Stanley&apos;s Adam Jonas named Tesla stock a &quot;top pick&quot; on Monday, a month after removing that designation. He kept a 430 price target for TSLA with an 800 bull case. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Musk said on the Q4 earnings call that Tesla will begin paid robotaxi service in Austin this June. But there&apos;s skepticism that this will occur, given unofficial data tracking Full Self-Driving disengagements. Musk has promised self driving &quot;this year&quot; or &quot;next year&quot; for a decade, will be correct this time. It&apos;s possible that Tesla will roll out robotaxis in a small part of Austin, using a human safety driver. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Please follow Ed Carson on Threads at @edcarson1971 and X/Twitter at @IBD_ECarson for stock market updates and more. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;      View this article at Investors.com </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-sp-500-losers-2025-tsla-expensive/ </p>&#10;<p>&#10;      Investor&apos;s Business Daily - Your edge in the stock market </p>&#10;<p>&#10;      This content was created by Investor&apos;s Business Daily, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
