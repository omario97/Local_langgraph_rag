<p>&#10;  Al Root </p>&#10;<p>&#10;  Tesla stock fell early Thursday after a bull said he expects shares of the electric-vehicle maker to move lower -- and soon. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     He made a similar call a year ago -- and was right. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Baird analyst Ben Kallo made Tesla a &quot;Bearish Fresh Pick&quot; on Wednesday evening. Baird uses the &quot; Fresh Pick&quot; designation when the broker feels a stock will move up or down soon. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     The call seems to be impacting shares, although the market looked weak Thursday. Tesla stock was down 2% in premarket trading at $273.45, while S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were down 1% and 0.9%, respectively. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     For Tesla, Kallo believes first-quarter delivery estimates are too high. Wall Street expects the EV maker to deliver between 425,000 and 435,000 cars. That estimate was about 470,000 at the start of the year. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     However, early-year regional sales data from China and Europe have been relatively weak, raising fears Tesla will miss deliveries estimates. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     &quot;Production downtime associated with the Model Y refresh complicates the supply-side of the equation while at the same time, (CEO Elon) Musk&apos;s involvement with the Trump administration adds uncertainty to the demand-side,&quot; wrote Kallo. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     It is shaping up to be a very messy quarter. Tesla delivered about 387,000 cars in the first quarter of 2024. Wall Street still expects growth. Kallo isn&apos;t as sure. His new estimate is just under 387,000 cars. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     For the full year, Kallo projects just more than 2 million cars sold, a little higher than Wall Street and up from 1.8 million sold in 2024. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     The odd thing about the report is that Kallo still rates shares Buy. He didn&apos;t downgrade the stock. He believes investors should brace for -- or wait for -- this rough patch to pass. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Rough patch puts it mildly. Coming into Thursday, Tesla stock has fallen about 31% this year. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     &quot;We continue to view Tesla as a core holding long term and see the company as the leader in real-world AI, but are bearish near-term through the Q1 delivery report,&quot; added the analyst. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Kallo is a bull for the long-run. He did lower his target price to $370 from $440 a share on Wednesday. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Overall, the average analyst price target for Tesla stock is about $374, according to FactSet. About 47% of analysts covering the stock rate shares Buy. The average Buy-rating ratio for stocks in the S&amp;P 500 is about 55%. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Kallo added the &quot;Bearish Fresh Pick&quot; label to Tesla in January 2024, while maintaining his Buy rating. Shares were about $190 a piece. Back then, Kallo believed the Delaware Court decision to void Musk&apos;s pay package created an overhang for shares. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     His call turned out to be prescient. Kallo removed his &quot;Fresh Bearish Pick&quot; in early April when shares were closer to $170 each, and less than two weeks before the stock hit a 52-week low below $140 on April 22. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Write to Al Root at  allen.root@dowjones.com </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     This content was created by Barron&apos;s, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
