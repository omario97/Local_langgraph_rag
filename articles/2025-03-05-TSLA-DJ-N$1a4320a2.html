<p>&#10;     A thorny problem is growing at Tesla, where sales are notably slowing in some markets as vehicle shoppers steer clear of the electric vehicle company run by CEO Elon Musk, an increasingly polarizing figure because of his work as the Trump administration&apos;s chief federal government cost-cutter. </p>&#10;<pre>&#10;   -- Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas characterized recently weak sales &#10;      numbers as a &quot;buyers&apos; strike,&quot; as Musk&apos;s political activity turns off &#10;      core Tesla buyers -- those often politically left-leaning people looking &#10;      to go green by owning an EV. &#10; &#10;   -- Preliminary U.S. data do show a February rebound for Tesla sales. It sold &#10;      about 42,000 cars in the month, up about 14% from a year ago, according &#10;      to Ward&apos;s Automotive. But Tesla&apos;s February sales in France fell 26% from &#10;      a year ago. &#10; &#10;   -- Early numbers from the China Passenger Car Association showed Tesla&apos;s &#10;      February wholesale number, which includes exports and retail sales, &#10;      dropped 49%, likely affected by Tesla&apos;s Model Y changeover. The company &#10;      recently started selling an updated version of its best-selling vehicle &#10;      there. &#10; &#10;   -- The Chinese February drop follows January sales data that showed Tesla &#10;      underperforming in the U.S., Europe, and China. Sales fell in all three &#10;      regions from a year ago. Tesla shares are down 44% from their &#10;      postelection high of $488 a share in December. </pre>&#10;<p>&#10;     What&apos;s Next: Tesla shareholders potentially have another headache to treat after President Donald Trump&apos;s 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico. Tesla assembles its cars for the North American market in the U.S., but parts come from elsewhere. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     -- Al Root and Liz Moyer </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     *** </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Dear Quentin, </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     My husband of nine years refuses to make out a will or trust. I signed a prenuptial agreement -- dumb, I know -- that says I agree not to claim any of his estate. But the document stated he would set up a trust allowing me to reside in the home if he dies first and the trust would pay expenses. So if he did die without a trust or a will, what do you think would happen? He has one adult son from whom he is estranged. He is 71 and I am 69. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     -- Worried Wife </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Read the Moneyist&apos;s response here. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     -- Quentin Fottrell </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     *** </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     -- Newsletter edited by Liz Moyer, Patrick O&apos;Donnell, Rupert Steiner </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     This content was created by Barron&apos;s, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
