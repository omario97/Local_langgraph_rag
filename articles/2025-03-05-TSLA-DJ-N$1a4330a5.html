<p>&#10;  Al Root </p>&#10;<p>&#10;  Tesla stock rose early Wednesday. Three things helped: Trump, trade, and U.S. sales data. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Shares of the electric vehicle maker were 2.1% at $277.80, while S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were 0.8% and 0.7%, respectively. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Stocks, including Tesla, are higher after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Tuesday evening that a deal to lower tariffs with Canada and Mexico could come as early as Wednesday. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Import tariffs of 25% on both countries went into effect on Tuesday. Tariffs can raise costs and upset supply chains. They are particularly nettlesome for U.S. auto makers that source a significant percentage of the past in most cars assembled American from Canada and Mexico. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Ford Motor and General Motors shares fell 2.9% and 4.6% on Tuesday. Tesla stock dropped 4.4%. Ford shares were up 2.1% in premarket trading. GM share were up 5.1%. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Along with a deal, President Donald Trump thanked Tesla CEO Elon Musk by name in his Tuesday address to Congress while touting the cost cutting accomplishments of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency. &quot;Thank you, Elon. He&apos;s working very hard. He didn&apos;t need this. He didn&apos;t need this. Thank you very much. We appreciate it,&quot; said the president. &quot;Everybody here even this side [the Democrat&apos;s] appreciates it I believe. They just don&apos;t want to admit that.&quot; </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     DOGE has been controversial, even turning off some core Tesla buyers -- politically left leaning Americans that want to go green. Tesla&apos;s January sales dropped year over year in the U.S. and Europe, stoking investor fears that Musk&apos;s politics were hurting the Tesla brand. U.S. sales bounced back in February. It sold about 42,000 cars in the month, up about 14% from the 37,000 sold in February 2024, according to Ward&apos;s Automotive. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Investors will continue to watch for a sales rebound and DOGE activities in the coming months. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Coming into Wednesday trading, Tesla stock was up about 8% since the Nov. 5 election and down about 36% from the Jan. 20 inauguration. </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com </p>&#10;<p>&#10;     This content was created by Barron&apos;s, which is operated by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
