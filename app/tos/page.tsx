This Agreement takes effect on the date on which you first use the MicroSaaSFast software.

3. Unlimited Access Software License with Termination Rights

The MicroSaaSFast Software License facilitates the acquisition of MicroSaaSFast software through a single purchase, granting users unrestricted and perpetual access to its comprehensive functionalities. 

This license entails a straightforward and flexible arrangement, exempting users from recurring fees or subscriptions. However, it is important to acknowledge that the licensor retains the right to terminate the license without conditions or prerequisites. This termination provision enables the licensor to exercise control over software distribution and utilization.

Opting for the MicroSaaSFast Software License enables users to enjoy the benefits of the software while recognizing the licensor's unrestricted termination rights, which provide adaptability and address potential unforeseen circumstances.

4. Refunds

Due to the nature of digital products, the MicroSaaSFast boilerplate cannot be refunded or exchanged once access is granted.

5. Disclaimer

It is not warranted that MicroSaaSFast will meet your requirements or that its operation will be uninterrupted or bug-free. All express and implied warranties or conditions not stated in this Agreement (including without limitation, loss of profits, loss or corruption of data, business interruption or loss of contracts), so far as such exclusion or disclaimer is permitted under the applicable law are excluded and expressly disclaimed. This Agreement does not affect your statutory rights.

MicroSaaSFast shall not be liable or deemed to be in breach of contract by reason of any delay in performing, or failure to perform, any of its obligations if the delay or failure was due to any cause beyond its reasonable control. Notwithstanding contrary clauses in this Agreement, in the event that MicroSaaSFast are deemed liable to you for breach of this Agreement, you agree that MicroSaaSFast's liability is limited to the amount actually paid by you for your services or software, which amount calculated in reliance upon this clause. You hereby release MicroSaaSFast from any and all obligations, liabilities and claims in excess of this limitation.
